WARNING! Avoid loading large amount of text. 

Plugin used to split text into pages takes it's sweet time(and memory) to compute everything. For reference - 300kb text(about 100 pages) loads in about 10 second on my machine(not a beefy one). 

If you try loading something like 2mb, it will hang, run out of memory and crash. I didn't come up with a solution, so if you want to load something big - split it.
